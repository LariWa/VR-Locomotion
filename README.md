# VR-Locomotion

This project investigates different locomotion techniques in VR. It was developed as part of the course _Multimodal Interaction and Interfaces_ at KTH from December to January 2022. We were a group of four students including Yawen Deng, Fatemeh Bakhshoudeh, Andrea Maderthaner and me.  
During the project I improved my Unity programming skills as well as my research skills. More information about our project can be found in our Project Report.

## Abstract

Technologies have enabled walking in VR environments to be pleasant and immersive. VR
controllers, natural walking and Walking in Place (WIP) are some of the most popular walking
techniques in VR. In order to discover how walking experience is aƀected by these
technologies, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted. The user experience was
investigated in terms of game experience, immersive level and motion sickness level
respectively, of which were measured through questionnaires. In the process, participants
were required to finish the corresponding questionnaires after experiencing one estimated
technology, and were invited to interviews after all three tests. Quantitative data such as speed
and distance was also measured automatically during the game. The evaluation indicated that
Cybershoes, i.e the WIP technology used here, was the most challenging, but most tensive and
tiresome technology; VR controller was the most dizzying one; and natural walking was the
least tiring, but the least challenging one. The reason behind the motion sickness was also
discussed in the view of multimodal interaction, followed by a possible future development, e.g
a deeper investigation on motion sickness and the modification of the controller’s technical
details.
